# Portfolio Site (Zip-and-run)

Unzip, open `index.html` in your browser. No build step, no dependencies.

## Make it yours
1. Replace the placeholder photo at `assets/img/profile-placeholder.png` with your own image (same filename or update `data.json` photo.src).
2. Put your real details in `data.json`:
   - `name`, `signature`
   - `socials` links
   - `projects`, `labs` arrays
   - `experience` timeline
3. In `index.html`, update the `mailto:` address in the Contact section to your real email.
4. (Optional) Rename the "REWALL" logo text in the sidebar in `index.html` if you want.

## Want me to fill everything in?
Send me your CV and lab/project links. I can drop your real content directly into `data.json`, adjust sections, and polish the copy. If you send a headshot, I can crop it to square and add the yellow accent bars to match the mockup.

## Structure
